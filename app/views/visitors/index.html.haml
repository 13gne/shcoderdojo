        Safety Harbor CoderDojo is part of the #{link_to "CoderDojo", "http://www.coderdojo.com"} movement,  -- free, volunteer-led,
        community based programming clubs for young people. At a Dojo, young people, between 7 and 17, learn how to code, develop websites,
        apps, programs, games and explore technology in an informal and creative environment. In addition to learning to code attendees meet
        like minded people and are exposed to the possibilities of technology.

        Within the CoderDojo Movement there is a focus on community, peer learning, youth mentoring and self led learning,  with an emphasis
        on showing how coding is a force for change in the world.
