        CoderDojo is a volunteer-led community of free local programming clubs for young people.  At our Dojo, kids between 7 and 17
        learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and explore technology using MIT Scratch, HTML, JavaScript, Python,
        Ruby, TouchDevelop and more!
      %p
        There is a focus on community, collaborative creativity and self-led learning with an emphasis on helping others and showing
        how coding is a force for change in the world!  Most importantly, CoderDojo is about encouraging creativity and having fun in
        a social environment. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable, safe experience.
      %p
        Our Dojo is organized, run and mentored by volunteers (many of whom are parents) and since CoderDojoâ€™s inception, all Dojos
        have been completely free and open to all young people who wish to attend.  The #1 rule at our CoderDojo is Be Cool!
